  title = {{{dHSS}} - Distributed {{Peer}}-to-{{Peer}} Implementation of the {{LTE HSS}} Based on the Bitcoin/Namecoin Architecture},
  doi = {10.1109/ICCW.2016.7503813},
  abstract = {The Home Subscriber Server (HSS) within the packet core of the Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a key node leveraged for essential operations, such as mutual authentication and access control. This centralized node is essential for the overall network operation as it is the cornerstone of the cryptographic functions executed in a mobile network. It stores several parameters for each subscriber, including a copy of the secret key ki that is securely stored in the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM). The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has sparked the concern in the industry on the potential risk of control plane signaling overloads. Due to the traffic characteristics of IoT devices and the potential risk of malfunctioning or compromised devices, there is a potential risk for floods of signaling traffic overwhelming the mobile core network and, in particular, the HSS. Moreover, recent security research has theorized potential attacks against this central core network node that could be launched from a botnet of compromised smartphones. In this paper we theoretically introduce a novel distributed and secure Peer-to-Peer (P2P) implementation of the HSS. Based on the Bitcoin/Namecoin framework, this new architecture drifts away from the symmetric key model of the standard HSS and proposes a robust public key infrastructure. Moreover, it does not rely in central points of failure, it is resilient to signaling overload threats and allows to re-authenticate and re-generate mobile session keys frequently with zero control plane signaling load at the mobile core.},

Currently, there are several existing popular databases such as relational database like SQL and non-relational database (i.e. NoSQL). However, both types have their own drawbacks which could not be utilized in both online and offline modes concurrently. Therefore, the authors develop a database that supports both modes especially availability in offline mode without sacrificing consistency. The database is integrated with CRDT (conflict-free replicated data types) algorithm to handle and solve conflicts in synchronization process. Some tools and technologies are used in the database development including Apache Thrift for middleware, LevelDB for server database, and IndexedDB for temporary client database. The purpose of this development is to build a CRDT database with usable API for developer users. Finally, it is tested with scenarios to satisfy essential operations: add, remove, and update.},

Such modifications are well understood if performed sequentially on a single copy of the data, but if the data is replicated and modified concurrently on multiple devices, it is unclear what the semantics should be. In this paper we present an algorithm and formal semantics for a JSON data structure that automatically resolves concurrent modifications such that no updates are lost, and such that all replicas converge towards the same state (a conflict-free replicated datatype or CRDT). It supports arbitrarily nested list and map types, which can be modified by insertion, deletion and assignment. The algorithm performs all merging client-side and does not depend on ordering guarantees from the network, making it suitable for deployment on mobile devices with poor network connectivity, in peer-to-peer networks, and in messaging systems with end-to-end encryption.},
